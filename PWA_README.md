```

## 🚀 Testing Your PWA

### Local Development

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:1234
# Note: Service workers require HTTPS or localhost
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# The build/ folder is deployed to GitHub Pages
```

### Test PWA Features

1. **Chrome DevTools**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to **Application** tab
   - Check **Manifest** section (should show your app info)
   - Check **Service Workers** section (should be registered)
   - Run **Lighthouse** audit for PWA score

2. **Install Test**
   - Visit your deployed GitHub Pages URL
   - Look for install prompt (Chrome will show it automatically)
   - Or click the install icon in the address bar
   - Add to home screen and launch as standalone app

3. **Offline Test**
   - Visit the app while online
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Check "Offline" mode
   - Refresh the page - it should still load!

## 📱 Device-Specific Features

### iOS/Safari

- Custom status bar styling
- Apple touch icons configured

### Android/Chrome

## 🔧 Customization

### Change App Name
Edit `src/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Your New App Name",
  "short_name": "Short Name"
}
```

### Change Theme Colors
Edit `src/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "theme_color": "#your-color",
  "background_color": "#your-bg-color"
}
```

Also update `src/index.html`:
```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#your-color">
```

### Replace Icons
1. Create your 512x512 PNG icon
2. Use https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
3. Download and replace files in `src/icons/`
4. Rebuild: `npm run build`

### Update Service Worker Cache
Edit `src/service-worker.js` and change the cache version:
```javascript
const STATIC_CACHE = 'power-meter-static-v2';  // Increment version
const DYNAMIC_CACHE = 'power-meter-dynamic-v2';
```

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment

Your build is ready for GitHub Pages! The PWA will work correctly because:

1. ✅ All paths use relative URLs (`./`)
2. ✅ Service worker is at the root of build/
3. ✅ Manifest has correct scope and start_url
4. ✅ Icons are properly referenced

Just push the `build/` folder to your gh-pages branch or configure GitHub Pages to serve from `build/`.

## 🎯 PWA Best Practices Implemented

- [x] HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this)
- [x] Responsive viewport meta tag
- [x] Web app manifest
- [x] Service worker for offline functionality
- [x] Icons for all platforms
- [x] Theme colors configured
- [x] Fast load times with caching
- [x] Installable on mobile and desktop

## 📊 Expected Lighthouse Scores

Your app should achieve:
- **PWA**: 100/100 ✅
- **Performance**: 90+/100
- **Accessibility**: 90+/100
- **Best Practices**: 90+/100

## 🔍 Debugging

### Service Worker Not Registering?
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
// Make sure you're on HTTPS or localhost
// Clear browser cache and reload
```

### Manifest Not Loading?
```javascript
// Check the manifest link in index.html
// Verify manifest.json is in build/ folder
// Check browser console for errors
```

### Install Prompt Not Showing?
- Chrome shows install prompt only if PWA criteria are met
- User must visit the site at least twice (engagement signal)
- Check DevTools → Application → Manifest for issues

## 🎉 Success!

Your power meter app is now a PWA! Users can:
- 📲 Install it like a native app
- ⚡ Launch it instantly from their home screen
- 📴 Use it offline (with cached data)
- 💪 Enjoy a full-screen, app-like experience

Perfect for cyclists who want quick access to their power data on the go! 🚴‍♂️
